    "For several years now, Barcelona, like other major European cities, has been committed to diversifying the mobility of citizens and the people who move around it from their daily vicinity. The aim of these public policies is to curb or at least mitigate the congestion of mobility in the city and avoid all negative effects.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "In the case of Barcelona, there has been an increase in public transport, although there is some debate as to whether this is enough. But there is no doubt that there has been a strong commitment on the part of the different governments and political sensitivities to promote the use of bicycles. From the creation of a public bicycle rental service to the creation of an extensive network of bicycle lanes. Part of these policies is explained in this <a href=\"http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/bicicleta/en/opting-for-bicycles\" target=\"_blank\" >public website of the city</a>.\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "This capstone would try to detect if these policies have made different businesses in the bicycle sector flourish in the city and use these data to determine the best areas to establish new businesses.<br>\n",
    "In order to establish a model that predicts a good location, it will be assumed that the existence of businesses in the sector and his location is due to profitability rather than a short-term trend. The analysis will also be limited to geographic data without taking into account other values such as demographics, purchasing power or orography. New mobility systems such as electric scooters will also not be taken into account. In the section 'Discussion' we will analyse what these decisions represent. \n",

    "    The urban data for Barcelona have been obtained in 'geojson' format. They have been imported as a dataframe. \n",
    "Barcelona is made up of 73 neighbourhoods and 11 districts. The data of each neighbourhood are from the geopositioning point of view polygons.<br/> \n",
    "By loading the data we have taken advantage of this to obtain the area of each district and the most centred point within the neighbourhood. <br/>\n",
    "This data will be used to obtain the different points where to make calls to the Foursquare API.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>The bike lanes:</ins>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The current bike lane data is also available in 'geojson' and in this case are Linestrings. It has been loaded into a dataframe and will be used to make calculations on each store obtained.\n",

    "<ins>Bicycle shops in Foursquare:</ins>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "A call has been made to the Foursquare API focusing on latitude and longitude in the centre of Barcelona and results have been obtained for the bike rental and sale categories. In the first inspection it was detected that in the rental category, Foursquare also includes the points where you can take a bicycle from the public service offered by the city council of Barcelona. An attempt could be made to detect these public points, but there are several different cases and the study was preferred to be limited to bicycle sales centers.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "In order to have an important sample of Foursquare's data, it has been necessary to make calls in different parts of the city. The limits per Foursquare call are 100 results. To obtain sufficient results it has been decided to make a call in each neighborhood with a relatively low radius (3,500 meters). This results had to be cleaned properly to eliminate the null results and to eliminate the repeated results for appearing several times within the chosen radius.\n",

    "Since it seemed difficult to have results with supervised methods it has been proven at least to obtain a segmentation that could be useful to be able to have a simple model. The unsupervised method KMeans has been tested. The Elbow method has been used to obtain the ideal number of clusters and it has been seen that they were 3:\n",
